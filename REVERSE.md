Write a code to reverse a number
To reverse a number, you need to take the digits of the number and rearrange them in the opposite order.

Start by converting the number to a string, reverse that string, and then convert it back to an integer. This will give you the reversed version of the original number.
Example: If the number is 908701, take digits from last → 1, 0, 7, 8, 0, 9 → and make it 107809.
